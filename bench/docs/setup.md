The `data_sources` folder is included in the zip uploaded to [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15015062)

The path hierarchy of the data sources (that are themselves benchmarks) is as follows:
1. Root folder for all sources is `data_sources`
2. Each data data source has one subfolder with the shortest version of its name
3. Content folders of each data source are: 
   - `db`: the directory which is mounted to `/database` in the Virtuoso, open-source edition, Docker container
   - `dataset`: data files (in N-Triples or Turtle format) generated by the data generator of the respective benchmark
   - Queries are stored differently depending on if the data source benchmark uses templated queries or not:
     - If the data source benchmark uses templated queries, then they stored in the (generated) `query_templates` folder, and the substitutions for the variables of those queries are stored as csv files with corresponding header names in the `query_substitution_parameters` folder
     - If it does not, that is the queries can be executed as is, then they are stored in the `queries` folder
   - `src`: the source files of the benchmark that where used
   - `instructions.md`: any data source benchmark specific instructions, such as dataset generation

A SPARQL endpoint must be setup using Virtuoso for each data source/dataset, this can be done easily with docker as follows:
```sh
cd bench
docker run --detach --name virtdb_$NAME --env DBA_PASSWORD=1234 --publish 1111:1111 --publish  8890:8890 --volume `pwd`/data_sources/$NAME/db:/database openlink/virtuoso-opensource-7@sha256:e07868a3db9090400332eaa8ee694b8cf9bf7eebc26db6bbdc3bb92fd30ed010
```
Where `$NAME` is again the shortest version of the data source benchmark names (so no spaces, lower, etc).
This will create or use the db folder in the current working directory the store the state of the database, such that the docker container can be restarted with losing the persisted data.
The instructions for loading the generated dataset files into Virtuoso's SPARQL endpoint's default graph (which is what all queries are ran on) can be found [here](./setup_virtuose.md). Note that for each data source a separate SPARQL endpoint must be setup with a default graph with its dataset in it.
